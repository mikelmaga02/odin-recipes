    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Spanish omelette is an easy to make, filling, and enjoyable dish. The dish gained popularity during the French occupation of Spain during the early 19th century, becoming a staple for the impoverished Spanish population.</p>
    <p>While there are many variations of the Spanish omelette, this page will show the most basic recipe, using only potatoes, onions, and eggs. If you want to take this dish to the next level, consider adding some Iberian ham or red piquillo peppers after the omelette is cooked.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>One medium brown onion</li>
        <li>Two medium potatoes</li>
        <li>6 medium eggs</li>
        <li>Olive oil (enough to cover your pan)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by peeling your potatoes and slicing them finely. Try to maintain a consistent cut thickness throughout. </li>
        <li>Pour some liquid gold into your pan, enough to cover the entire pan, and heat up to medium heat.</li>
        <li>Once temperature is reached, toss the potatoes in the pan.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, chop the onion Julienne style.</li>
        <li>Check potatoes at the bottom of the pan, and if starting to crisp, flip them.</li>
        <li>After flipping potatoes, throw the onions into the pan, and let them cook for a further 10 minutes approx.</li>
        <li>Flip potatoes again and cook on higher heat for a final 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, beat the eggs</li>
        <li>Drain the oil from the pan and add the potato and onion mixture to the eggs.</li>
        <li>Add two teaspoons of salt, although this may vary. The trick is to use enough to darken the mixture.</li>
        <li>Heat the pan up to medium heat again and add the mixture. Flip after 1-2 minutes of cooking, helping yourself with a large plate.</li>
        <li>Cook for another minute, or longer depending on how cooked you want the omelette (I prefer it slightly runny).</li>
    </ol>
